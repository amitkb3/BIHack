 <h3>A few gotchas...</h3>
 <hr>
 <h4>Foreword: Security</h4>
 <p>No, this app is not secure, and is not meant to be. More on that later, but you should be aware that the "passwords" are not hashed at any point. Use the web-app and re-use the code responsibly.</p>
 <hr>
 <h4>Why?</h4>
 <p>I took part in the - amazing - <a href = "http://www.bayesimpact.org/hack">Bayes Impact Hackathon</a> on November 15/16, and was a bit frustrated by the inability to team up efficiently if you didn't know personally some people going to the hackathon too.
   I came up with this idea a couple of days before the start of the hackathon and hacked away a rougher version of this prototype for the d. The solution came too late (you need such a thing rougly one week <i>before</i> the hckathon itself to be efficiently used)</p>
   <h4>How ?</h4>
   <p>This also part of the why: I was playing with <a ref = "http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a>, a sort of template language for quick web-development in R. I wanted to see if I could implement this idea of mine quickly using this new tool. It worked out pretty well, and well enough for me to want finishing it.</p>
 <h4>Potential Optimizations</h4>
 <p>The two panels that show the participants are insanely slow to load if there is 20+ people to show. This could be hugely improved by not creating the plots on the fly each time the page is loaded, since it is clearly the biggest time-eater of the operations.</p>
 <h4>More on Security</h4>
 <p>The app is absolutely not secure, but it isnt the point. The data that participants share here is not meant to be private, and there is enough emphasis at password creation to not choose your favorite one.
   If one wanted to secure the app, though here are the few steps I isolated:</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>Password field</dt>
    <dd>I implemented it out of curiosity. (See the file globals.R, <code>passwordInput()</code> is a modified version of <code>shiny::textInput()</code>) But again, the whole point is to make the user aware of the absence of security, hence I left the classic <code>textInput()</code> in place.</dd>
    <dt>Password salting+hashing</dt>
    <dd>Create a random salt at user creation, store it in the data base. Store the hash of (password + salt). Everything could be done in R (the 'scrypt' package provides a good, simple toolbox for that).</dd>
    <dt>Implement SSL over https</dt>
    <dd>The stuff above is useless without this. It might be the longer part depending on your current setup.</dd>
    <dt>Prevent dl of password fields</dt>
    <dd>Well, that's obvious. You can currently download the whole database as a sqlite file, but Shiny lets you create a download feature easily that would give you a .csv with whatever field you choose.</dd>
